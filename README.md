# Descriptioin of the project.

## Main goal

The first goal of the app is to help people to get into the programming and to avoid the problem
of dissapproval amoung other programmers.

The system solves this problem by allowing people, who only start to code, to work together on small project that they choose by themselves. The overall progress is controlled by a experience mentor who tracks the team's success. Users can create the projects (for example implement the copy of Facebook) by their own and later wait for people who also interested to join in.

The second problem that is solved in this application is the problem of what language or framework to choose. The tool helps users to know what frameworks and technologies are used with some specific programming lanugage. All of this is done a very user-friendly way using charts and diograms.
